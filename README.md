# Project Waste Not

## Project 01
Provide some Python code that can be used to measure how long a function takes to run in a friendly format. The amount of time can range from less than a second to several hours and should be easy for a human to read (for example “00:00:00:00012” is not a good output).

## Project 02
We have a system where we need to implement auto-save when a user enters numeric quantities for an order and it should also indicate to the user when their data is saved.

It should not save after every keystroke since that would be too many calls to our backend. It should only save after the user hasn’t typed any number for 2 seconds.

For simulating the call to our server, it should simulate a 1 second delay.

Create a page that will have an edit field where the user will enter the number. After 2 seconds if the user hasn’t pressed any keys it should display on the page “Auto-saving”. After the 1 additional second where it simulates calling our server it should display “Saved”.
